# Scripts for running pipelines

The following scripts all use the `set-env.sh` file to configure the environment.
Please review these properties to switch filesystems (e.g. EFS, HDFS, Local FS) and between cluster and non-cluster.

The scripts in this directory are temporary and will be superceded by the work in https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/la-pipelines/issues/88
